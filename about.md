Hello, My name is Yuri Alves. A Guernsey Developer

### More Information

This blog is for me to keep track of my progress and to see what works for me, when it comes to me meeting my goal of losing weight.
This blog is also so I can share my ideas and attract potential employeers

#### General information about me.

My full name is Yuri Nunes Alves.

I am currently 18, born on the 22 January 1999.

I am currently living in Guernsey, which is currently freezing. For people who don’t know of Guernsey, it is a small island, south of England, we are also know as the Channel Island or the island next to Jersey.

I am currently a business studies student in my first year at the Guernsey College of Further Education.

My future goals are to lose weight, get a good paying job(maybe as a lawyer), and have fun with everything in life, as I feel if you don’t, life would be dull
